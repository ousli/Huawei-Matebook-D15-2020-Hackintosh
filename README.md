## Guide
### Windows Installation
1. Create bootable USB for Windows with [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/fr/)
2. Check the box ` Remove requirement for Secure Boot and TPM 2.0` ![Rufus](img/rufus.png)
3. Install Windows normally
4. Open Disk Management tool
5. In case you have a single SSD, select your C: partition and click on `Shrink Volume`. ![Shrink Volume](img/disk_management.png)
6. MacOS requires  about 30 go of storage. In my case, my SSD has 500go so I remove 250go from the C: partition
7. Create a new simple volume with the unallocated storage and name it

### MacOS Installation
1. Prepare the USB key for MacOS with the [OpenCore Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)
2. When it's done reboot your computer and open the BIOS `(F2 for Huawei Laptop)`
3. Disable `Secure Boot`
4. Save and exit `(F10 for Huawei Laptop)`
5. Open boot menu `(F12 for Huawei Laptop)`
6. Select your bootable USB key
7. Open disk utility
8. - Select the partition you created before
